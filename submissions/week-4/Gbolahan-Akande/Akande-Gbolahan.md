### Task-stylus-js

**GitHub:** [https://github.com/gboigwe/stylus-as-example](https://github.com/gboigwe/stylus-as-example)

**Description:**
Refactored the Stylus AssemblyScript prime calculator to solve the "minimum even prime" problem. Since 2 is mathematically the only even prime number, this implementation showcases how understanding the problem domain can lead to dramatic code simplification.


### Task: zig-stylus-assignment

**GitHub:** [https://github.com/gboigwe/zig-stylus](https://github.com/gboigwe/zig-stylus)

**Summary:**  
Successfully forked the zig-stylus repo, documented all files, and built WASM contracts. Contract structure passes Stylus validation, but discovered that the SDK's VM hook function names (like `storage_store_bytes32`) don't match the current Stylus runtime's available imports. This indicates the Zig SDK needs updates for compatibility with the latest Stylus version.

**Progress:** WASM compilation, Entrypoint recognition, VM hooks compatibility


### Task: node-full-chain-simulation

**GitHub:** N/A (Local environment setup - no code repository needed)

**Summary:**  
Successfully deployed and ran a complete local Arbitrum development environment using the official nitro-testnode. Set up L1 Geth chain (localhost:8545) and L2 Stylus-enabled Nitro chain (localhost:8547) with working RPC endpoints. Verified chain configurations, tested helper scripts for funding addresses, and confirmed Docker containers running properly. Environment is ready for smart contract development and cross-layer testing.

**Progress:** Environment Setup, Chain Verification, RPC Testing, Helper Scripts
