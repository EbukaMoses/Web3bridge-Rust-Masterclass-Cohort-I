Description: 

This fork demonstrate a minimal Stylus smart contract that returns the smallest even prime number â€” which is always 2.

Instead of computing all primes up to a given number n, the logic has been simplified to return the only even prime number (2). This showcases a basic AssemblyScript contract in Stylus for educational and testing purposes.

Task: node-full-chain-simulation
GitHub: N/A (Local environment setup - no code repository needed)

### ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Set up and run a **complete local full-chain simulation** using Arbitrumâ€™s **Nitro Testnode**. This environment includes:

* A dev-mode Ethereum L1 Geth chain
* An L2 Nitro rollup chain (Stylus-enabled by default)
* (Optional) L3 chain support
* Token bridges and a Blockscout explorer

This setup enables you to **locally deploy, test, and debug** Stylus or standard smart contracts in a controlled multi-layer environment ([Arbitrum Docs][1], [Arbitrum Docs][2]).
