### Task: node-full-chain-simulation

**Objective:** Launch a full local Stylus-enabled chain simulation.

**Completed Steps:**
- Cloned and ran `nitro-testnode --init`
- Interacted with L2 via `localhost:8547`
- Funded addresses using helper scripts
- (Optional) Deployed a contract using portable WASM/A.S./Zig logic

**Proof:**
- Screenshot or terminal log of running nodes
- `l2_chain_info.json` or contract interactions
