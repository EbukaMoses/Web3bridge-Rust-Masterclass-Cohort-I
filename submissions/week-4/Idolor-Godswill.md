**Description:**
Forked the Stylus AssemblyScript example (Sieve of Eratosthenes) and modified it to return the minimum even prime number (which is always 2), instead of calculating all prime numbers up to a limit. 

This simplified example demonstrates how to write and deploy a minimal smart contract with Stylus using AssemblyScript.
