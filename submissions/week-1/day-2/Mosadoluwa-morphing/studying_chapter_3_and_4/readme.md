##Remaining part of Chapter 3

- Function: can be defined before or after "main", it doesn't matter, as long as it is called within main. Codes run from within main in a top-down order. 
- Parameters: must always be assigned a "type". e.g. i32, char, etc. 
- Statements and Expressions: The former does not return a value, the latter does; but an expression can be part of a statement. e.g (let y = 5;) is a statement and (let y = 5) is an expression; notice the semi-colon.
- Comments
- Control Flow (if else, else if, loops)
