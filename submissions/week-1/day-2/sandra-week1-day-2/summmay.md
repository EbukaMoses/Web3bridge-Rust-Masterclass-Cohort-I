### Task 1: Study Chapters of The Rust Book,Study the **remaining of Chapter 2** and **all of Chapter 3** of [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)

#### Solution

##### Chapter 3

###### Control flow

- **how to use if expressions to decide which block of code to run based on a Boolean condition.**
- **how to use the three main Rust loop types .while (conditional), and for (iterates over collections or ranges).**
- **How Function Parameters must have explicitly declared types.**
- **How and when to use the for loop**

##### Chapter 4

###### Ownership,Borrowing & Referencing, and Slice type in Rust

- **I Understandstood that ownership is a set of rules that govern how a Rust program manages memory.**
- **The main goal of ownership in rust is to minimize unexpected updates to data in the memory**
- **every data is own by a variable in rust and reasssigning their values to another variable moves this value into the new variable and makes the old value inaccessible**

#### Task 2: Basic Arithmetic in Rust

#### Solutions
