# Summary

Chapter 2 – Guessing Game Tutorial
Rust project structure: You understand how to create and run a project using cargo.

Taking input: Using std::io::stdin().read_line() to get user input.

Shadowing variables: Reusing a variable name to change its type (e.g., from String to u32).

Using trim() and parse():

trim() removes \n or extra spaces.

parse() converts a String to a number, with error handling using expect().

Enums and match:

Ordering enum (Less, Equal, Greater)

match arms and control flow based on comparison

Type system:

Rust needs values to be the same type when comparing (String vs u32 won't work).

Strong, static typing:

You now know Rust catches type mismatches at compile time.

Chapter 3 – Common Programming Concepts
Scalar types:

You understand the 4 basic scalar types: i32, f64, bool, and char.

You can relate them to real-world data (e.g., age, pi, on/off switch, emoji).

Compound types:

Tuple: fixed-length, mixed-type group (e.g., ("Alice", 30, true)).

Array: fixed-length, same-type list (e.g., [1, 2, 3, 4]).

Function basics:

You wrote functions for add, subtract, multiply, divide.

You understand function definitions, parameters, return types.
