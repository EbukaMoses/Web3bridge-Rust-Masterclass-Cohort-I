# STUDY SUMMARY

From my reading, I now understand the different data types in Rust, especially the distinction between scalar and compound types. I learnt that arrays in Rust have a fixed size and type, while vectors are more flexible and can grow dynamically. I also explored loops—such as the loop keyword, which runs indefinitely unless there's an instruction to terminate the loop either with a break keyword or manually on the terminal. Additionally, I grasped the difference between statements and expressions, and how functions are declared, including the role of type annotations and return values.

## Question

While going through the section on integer overflow - chapter 3, I was able to follow the use of wrapping_add and checked_add, but I'm still unclear about the purpose and workings of saturating_* and overflowing_* operations. 
Could you explain how these two work and in what scenarios they’re typically used?
