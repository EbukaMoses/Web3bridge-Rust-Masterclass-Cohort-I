# Basic Calculator in Rust

A simple command-line calculator implemented in Rust that demonstrates basic arithmetic operations with integers and floating-point numbers.

## Features
- **Integer Operations**: Addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication.
- **Float Operations**: Addition with 32-bit floating-point numbers.
- **Clean, readable function implementations**.

## Functions
- `add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32` - Adds two integers.
- `subtract(x: i32, y: i32) -> i32` - Subtracts two integers.
- `divide(x: i32, y: i32) -> i32` - Divides two integers.
- `multiply(x: i32, y: i32) -> i32` - Multiplies two integers.
- `add_float(x: f32, y: f32) -> f32` - Adds two floating-point numbers.

## Usage
### Build the project:
```bash
cargo build
```

### Run the program:
```bash
cargo run
```

## Example Output
```
The sum of the two numbers is 12
The subtraction of the two numbers is -2
The division of the two numbers is 0
The multiplication of the two numbers is 35
The addition of floats is 10
```
